### Iterations


## Marijn
Marijn Meijles is a software architect, father, and wheelchair-aficionado with a motor impairment. Marijn doesn't think he's really disabled, even though he's in a wheelchair and has a hard time communicating.

### User scenario
Marijn Meijles is a software architect, father, and "wheelchair-aficionado" with a motor impairment. Precise mouse-movement and keypresses are difficult for him, so Marijn relies on his keyboard for navigation. Marijn wants to be able to view and rate our projects quick and easy. He needs to be able to test the project and quickly go back to the overview page. He also needs to know who designed the project so he can give that person feedback. Key events will help Marijn navigate through the pages. After testing a project, Marijn will be able to choose from different sentences to set the mood for the feedback round. These sentences are given, but can be personalized.

## Exclusive design
Inclusive design was created so designers would have guidelines to follow to make sure their designs would -theoretically- include everyone (even people with disabilities). The inclusive design principles are `consider all contexts`, `be consistent`, `prioritize content` and `add value`. Of course this doesn't work that way, disabled people we're still excluded.

For this course we'll be following the exclusive design guidelines. These are actually the opposite of the inclusive design principles.

#### 1. Study situation
Marijn is a developer, so he is used to working with a computer. He has a macbook pro and uses [sticky keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_keys) and tab navigation. He only uses his left hand to control his keyboard.

#### 2. Ignore conventions
**"The defaults suck"**, therefore I will not be using the default conventions. Usually conventions are used to add accessibility to a page because "people are familiar with the pattern", but this doesn't necessarily mean it's the best solution.

Marijn is unable to use his mouse or trackpad. Precise movements are difficult for Marijn due to his motor impairment. Therefore he relies on his keyboard for navigation. Because Merlijn only uses his left hand, relying on the arrows on the right of the keyboard could be unpleasant for him. Therefore I will use other keys (on the left-side of the keyboard). Also pressing a key one time may be hard for him, so repeating keypresses should not interfere with the usability.

#### 3. Prioritize (user) identity
I think Marijn is an overall positive person. He doesn't think he's really disabled, so I don't want to treat him like he is. I intend to make something, specifically for him, but not emphasize his disability. I looked at Marijns social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook) and saw him "joking" about riding his wheelchair and joking in general. I want to use this humor and positivity in my website to make him feel comfortable and accepted.

#### 4. Add nonsense  
I want to help Marijn communicate his feedback using "funny" sentences. For the prototype I will write the sentences myself, but eventually I want him to be able to edit the sentences. The idea is for Marijn to select the sentence he wants to play the audio. I also want to add audio feedback to the correct keypress, this way Marijn will know if he pressed the right key.
To top the nonsense box I will add a wheelchair animation somewhere.
